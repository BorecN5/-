# Japanese Grammar: Particles (助詞・じょし)

Particles are the glue of Japanese sentences — small but mighty!  
Here's a basic list of the most common ones you need for JLPT N5.

## 🟢 は (wa) – Topic Marker
**Structure:** [Topic] は [Comment]

📌 *私　は　学生　です*  
👉 I am a student.  
*私* is the topic.

## 🔵 を (wo) – Direct Object Marker
**Structure:** [Subject] は [Object] を [Verb]

📌 *パン を 食べmす。*  
👉 (I) eat bread.  
パン is what you eat.

## 🟡 に (ni) – Destination / Time / Indirect Object
**Used for:** places you go *to*, time, recipient of an action

📌 *学校　に　行きます。* – I go to school  
📌 *８時　に　おきます。* – I wake up at 8

## 🔴 で (de) – Place of Action

## 🧠 Tips:
- は is **not** pronounced "ha" when it's a particle – it becomes **"wa"**.
- Particles often **don’t translate directly**, but they shape meaning a lot!
- Practice with simple sentences — don’t just memorize, **use** them!
